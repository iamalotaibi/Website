## Notes

### Plan

I have found [this project on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/gj958s/p_nifty_online_tool_animates_your_actions_in/) by [yemount](https://github.com/yemount). It seems that the project delivers what I am trying to accomplish in this project but using pose-estimate (detecting the entire body) and 2D image.
