[[Obsidian]]

-   Zettelkasten method
    -   ~~take literature notes -> removed from Obsidian~~
    -   take reference notes -> source note
    -   create permanent notes
    -   review notes
-   know how to move stuff from Obsidian to Anki automatically using some script or plugin
    -   what I want is the ability to import my notes into anki
    -   \[\[file^type a sentence \| rename it]]
