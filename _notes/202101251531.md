    -   method
        -   before lecture
            -   skim assigned chapter
            -   read through chapter backwards
                -   e.g. take learning objective 1 and find the answer
                -   take notes of the ideas
                -   solve simple problems
                -   make an anki card of it
        -   during lecture
            -   take notes in Q+A form
                -   e.g. what is another name for the ....? ANS: ...
        -   after lecture
            -   skim notes
            -   make the Q+A into Anki cards
    -   The lecture is supposed to reinforce the reading you already did, and walk you through the most important concepts
    -   You should not start putting information into your spaced repetition system before you understand it
    -   You cannot actively listen to a lecture, process the material, understand it instantly, and make a flashcard while continue to actively listen

    -   method
        -   before lecture
            -   make an outline of the lecture in my own words
            -   highlight key words or topics
            -   write a few questions on what I think the important topics are
        -   during
            -   take some notes
            -   try to get an idea of main ideas and connect them
        -   1st pass
            -   color code info highlights and underlines
            -   fill in missing info
        -   2nd pass
            -   have notes open and make anki cards from them
            -   double check with premade decks on the big topics covered too
        -   after/during review
            -   if there is a difficult concept to make a card for, don't understand fully, or miss it a lot on Anki, I will read up or search for more info about it
            -   make a review sheet for it
            -   take a screenshot of it and add it to revalvent cards
