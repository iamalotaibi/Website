-   [[Niklas Luhmann]], the creator of Zettelkasten
-   " I only do what is easy" - [[Niklas Luhmann]]

    -   start all over with the next project
-   The actual productivity
    -   Thinking, connecting, and understanding
    -   Focus on the process (not the outcome)
    -   Writing is broken down into reasonable steps (one note at a time)
        -   write 3-6 notes a day
    -   The value of each idea compounds (more notes, better)
        -   connect all notes rather than storing in in an archive
    -   Clear distinction between permanent and temporary notes
        -   everything in an inbox and check whether they are required to add to your set of notes or not - [[Getting Things Done]]
-   the actual learning (is - not)
    -   spacing - cramming
        -   flashcards (anki), issue no context
    -   interleaving - one thing at a time
        -   baby steps, start easy and increase difficulty
    -   connecting - compartmentalization
    -   self-testing - underlining and copying
        -   test your knowledge
    -   elaboration - re-reading
        -   when re-reading, it feels familiar so we think that it is productive. However, it isn't.
        -   elaboration, ask questions about what you came across
            -   what is it about?
            -   what does it mean for...?
            -   how does it connect with...?
            -   swapping perspectives: from the context of the source to the context of ones own thoughts
                -   from my point-of-view, why this is important and useful?
            -   does it contradict, complement, confirm or specify what I believed before?
    -   creativity, it doesn't happen suddenly. It needs time and focus
