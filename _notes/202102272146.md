- Region of Interest (RoI) = proposal network
- RoI are mapped to the model's feature map
- Quantization of coordinates on the feature map
	- Quantization = from real numbers to discrete numbers
	- In case of feature maps, flooring values
- RoI Pooling
	- RoI Pooling layer -> FCL (with fixed size)
	- 4x6 (RoI) -> 3x3 (RoI pooling)
	- Pooling could be Max or Avg.



RoI generates proposals for the model to use in later steps. The process of RoI contains the following: 1) Selection of
