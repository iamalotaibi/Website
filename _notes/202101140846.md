[[Career]]

-   If you have different offers, you should use it
    -   when you state the given offers, don't give the fixed salary, but give them a range including the benefits
        -   Bad: I have got an offer from company X for 97k
        -   Good: I have got an offer from company X 100-110k with benefits
        -   to negotiate, you can state that your company offers 60-65k with package and another company offers 70-75k, but I like your company due to the future opportunities and I fit better. If we could split the difference and bump to 67.5k, I'd really conf. joining your company
    -   when you do the interview, you can ask to round your salary a bit more (56k->60k) and they will accept it as they won't need to go through recuritment again as it will cost more
-   If you don't have offers, you should do the following
    -   Study the market for the actual price that you should get and increase a bit toward it
    -   If you can't ask for more salary, ask for (with any reasonable reason for why you want any or all of these things)
        -   more benefits
        -   more off days
        -   a better company laptop
-   If you are doing interviews with other companies
    -   If they offered you 56k at the end of the interview, you can state that the offer is too low for the given financial obligations. Unfortunately if we aren't able to that up to at least 60k, I am going to interview with these other companies that I am recruiting with (companies hate to wait for a respond after you interview with competitors)
