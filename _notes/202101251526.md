        -   #develop = still in progress
    -   LYT add to Zettlekasten

        -   Zettlekasten = note structure (bottom-up)
        -   folders (top-down)
    -   new notes that doesn't belong to MOCs yet, link to concepts MOC so you can view them on the links to be added to MOCs later on
    -   use #Evergreen to refactor a note
    -   doesn't add MOCs to the home note

                -   add to the bottom, links: 0X0 YYY MOC
    -   Progressive Summerization = the idea of highlighting what you read and summarize it into a note (aka copy-paste)
        -   it should be exteremly low as you aren't making notes, but taking them
    -   notes should be about a page long
    -   create notes based on the idea of the article not the article
    -   when doing a research about a project and would like to use MOC
