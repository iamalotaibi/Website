-   Taxicab geometry (Manhattan dist.):

    -   backstory: because of the grid layout of the city Manhattan. Any path that the driver take, will take the same number of intersection and length to reach to the final destination. The red, blue, and yellow lines are the possible paths to take from a point into another. Although they are all different, they both have the same total length and number of intersection, and they all share the same shortest path to the final destination!

-   It is called also L1-norm and LASSO in [[Machine Learning]]
