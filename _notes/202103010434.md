[[Computer Vision]]

- R-CNN
	- pipeline
		- uses selective search to identify a manageable number of bbox object region candidates (RoI)
		- extracts CNN features from each region independently for classification
	- workflow
		- pre-train: CNN (VGG or other models trained on ImageNet)
		- Propose category - independent RoI by selective search (~2k candidates per image)
		- Region candidates are warped to have a fixed size to be feed to CNN
		- Fine-tuning the CNN on warped proposal regions for K+1  classes (+1=background). Use smaller learning rate and mini-batch oversamples the positive cases because most RoI are background
		- Given every image region, one forward propogation through CNN generates a feature vector, then consumed by a binary SVM trained for each class independently. The selection of positive samples are based on IoU (intersection-over-union) overlap >= threshold
		- To reduce the localization errors, a regression model is trained to correct the predicted detection window on bbox correction offset using CNN features
	- bbox regression
		- given a predicted bbox coordinate p = (p_x, p_y,p_w,p_h), (p_x,p_y) = center coordinates, (p_w,p_h) = width, and height and ground truth coordinates g = (g_x, g_y,g_w,g_h)
		- the regressor learns:
			- scale-invariant transformation between two centers
			- log-scale transofmration between widths and heights
		- cont.
