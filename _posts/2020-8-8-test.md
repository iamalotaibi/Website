## Setting up SSH

At OSU, FLIP server is our access point server and DGX server is a cluster server that I would like to access, so in order to access the DGX server, I would need to access the FLIP server first. The `ProxyJump` configuration states that if I want to access the DGX server, I would need to access the FLIP server first. This step is needed for VS code's extension, `Remote - SSH`, to have access to the DGX server.

### SSH config

TODO: how to

```bash
Host FLIP # access point server
    HostName access.engr.oregonstate.edu
    User ONIDusername
Host DGX # target server
    HostName submit-b.hpc.engr.oregonstate.edu
    User ONIDusername
    ProxyJump FLIP
```

`Austin L.` for sharing `ngrok` and `Aayam S.` for sharing how `ngrok` and `jupyter notebook` could be used together.
