# Summer 2019
For this summer, I will attempt to study [TensorFlow in Practice](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice), [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), [Advanced Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml), and [Reinforcement Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) to review these topics, build more relevant projects to these topics, and construct a curriculum for the AI Club. [Career Success Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/career-success) and [Understanding the Brain: The Neurobiology of Everyday Life](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurobiology) to improve my general understanding.
